Hi,

Iâ€™m Riaz,
a Data Analyst who loves digging into the data and making sense of the chaos. Whether itâ€™s building dashboards that tell a story or transforming messy data into clear insights, or connecting dots by following data clues.

Hereâ€™s what Iâ€™m all about:

ðŸ”§ Tools: Power BI, Advanced Excel â€“ I turn complex data into something you can actually use.

ðŸ’» Tech Skills: MySQL, Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Selenium, BeautifulSoap) â€“ I work with data to find trends and insights that drive action.

ðŸ’¬ What I Do Best: Communicating clearly, solving problems, adapting quickly, and making sure the data serves its purpose.

Iâ€™m always experimenting, learning new tricks, and looking to collaborate. If you want to see how data can work for you, letâ€™s chat.
